# Unit 3 Challenge: Code Bootstrap Portfolio

## Overview

In this project, I built a portfolio using the Bootstrap CSS Framework. To help me understand Bootstrap better, I tried to mainly utilise their assets and applying classes rather than fully writing my own code.

Requirements were as follows: 
* a nav bar
* navigation menu at the top of the page, with links that are applicable to your portfolio and navigate to the appropriate sections
* a hero section, including my name, picture and any relevant info
* a work section showcasing current projects displayed in a grid using cards
* a skills section highlighting the skills I expect to learn from the bootcamp
* an about/contact section
* a footer
* all hyperlinks should have a hover effect
* all buttons should display a box shadow
